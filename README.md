# Full Stack Development Journey

### A journey which took me from a Mediocre to Full Stack Developer

## Introduction

This is my personal journey/guide for going from a basic Full Stack Web & C++
Developer to a full-fledged Full Stack Developer. Over the last few years, I
have been learning C++ & Web Development and have gotten to a point where my
learning has more or less stagnated, while I have hardly learned all there is to
know about either.

This Github repo was created in part to document my journey of learning but was
also created for anyone who wants to follow along with the same tutorials and
projects that I did.

_Note that this is just my personal journey of "filling in the blanks" of
knowledge that I didn't have previously_

Without too much talking, let's get started!

## What I Knew Going In

Before starting this challenge, I had been learning on my own and making little
projects with (HTML, CSS, JQuery/JS), C++, Python, NodeJs for several years. The
only formal education in coding I had gotten was a year-long certificate program
back in 2018 at UCSD Extension which had allowed me to get a firm grasp on the
fundamentals of C/C++.
