# TenWeekCodeChallenge
### A ten week journey which took me from a jack of all trades to Full Stack Developer

## Introduction
This is my personal ten week code challenge (currently ongoing) for going from a
basic Full Stack Web & C++ Developer to a full-fledged Full Stack Developer.
Over the last few years, I have been learning C++ & Web Development and have
gotten to a point where my learning has more or less stagnated, while I have
hardly learned all there is to know about either.

For the challenge, I compiled a list of ten technologies that are important to
Full Stack development. This Github repo was created in part to document my
journey of learning these 10 but was also created for anyone who wants to follow
along with the same tutorials and projects that I made.

Without too much talking, let's get started!

## What I Knew Going In
Before starting this challenge, I had been learning on my own and making little
projects with (HTML, CSS, JQuery/JS), C++, Python, NodeJs for several years. The
only formal education in coding I had gotten was a year-long certificate program
back in 2018 at UCSD Extension which had allowed me to get a firm grasp on the
fundamentals of C/C++.
